*An OpenAM Sample OAuth 2.0 Scopes Plugin*

For instructions on using this sample OAuth 2.0 scopes plugin with OpenAM
see the chapter,
*[Customizing OAuth 2.0 Scope Handling](http://openam.forgerock.org/openam-documentation/openam-doc-source/doc/dev-guide/index/chap-oauth2-scopes.html)*,
in the OpenAM *Developer's Guide*.

Before building the sample scopes plugin, update the OpenAM version in the POM
to match the version of OpenAM that you are using.

The line to update is:

    <openam.version>12.0.0-SNAPSHOT</openam.version>
